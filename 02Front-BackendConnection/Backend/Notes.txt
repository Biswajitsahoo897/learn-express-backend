There are two ways to access the file one way is commonjs &
Another is modules 
we have to set this at the time of 'npm init' type:"module"



--------------------------------------------
DONT USE THIS APPROACH EVER ,IT'S VERY BAD
--------------------------------------------


we can also run 'npm run bulid' in the frontend but have to copy that build folder to the backend 

use a middleware 

by this one line

app.use(express.static('dist'))//static file serving dist

But the problem is if someone changed the frontend CODE ,that won't propagate to the backend 
You have to again run command and copy paste that folder so...
so the best practice is to segregate them 

but it's cost effective , u r money got saved ,because no CI/CD ,no devops ,no frontend eng effective
